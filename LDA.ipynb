    "Now that we have initialized our topic model, we are ready to sample. To sample, we pass three parameters. The first is the number of iterations we want the chain to burn in before beginning to sample. The second is a thinning interval, the number of iterations to let the chain run between samples. Allowing for a thinning interval reduces autocorrelation between samples. The third is the number of samples to take. So, for example, if the user passes (2000,50,20) the following will happen. First, the chain will run for 2,000 iterations. Then 20 samples will be taken corresponding to the $\\{2050,2100\\ldots,2950,3000\\}$ iterations for a total of 3000 iterations overall."
